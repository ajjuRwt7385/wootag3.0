            <h2 class="section-subtitle">Inspiration</h2>
            <p>Necessity is the mother of invention. And in this case, the simple desire for a stylish pair of sunglasses inspired a ‘lightbulb moment’.<br/><br/>Back in 2015, company Founder and CEO Raj Sunder was watching a movie online and liked the look of a character’s sunglasses. A fruitless online search for the glasses followed. Then another. And another. Leaving Raj wondering how much easier it would be if he could simply ‘click’ on the sunglasses the actor was wearing to find out what brand they were, and how he could get them.<br/><br/>That thought was the moment Wootag began.</p>
